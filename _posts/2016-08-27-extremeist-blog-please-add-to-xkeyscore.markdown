Many people like myself years ago believed that the American government would have setup a system to automatically monitor activity and keywords on the Internet.  With all the releases from Edward Snowden and other sources we now have proof that of course they have systems like this in place, a spy agency will spy.

Now you may think, that's all fine and good, they only want terrorists - yeah right. Seems that if you read the magazine Linux Journal then you are flagged for possible further investigation.  I read Linux Journal, so flag this blog and add it to XKEYSCORE please. I'd be happy to have a NSA analyst read my rants.
